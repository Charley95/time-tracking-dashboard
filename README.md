## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript 


### What I learned

This challenge was a great way to get more practice on my css grid skills. More importantly, I got to work with JSON file for the first time and glad I got it to work after so many research and study.

### Continued development

I will love to continue practicing on working with JSON in JavaScript as I have not fully gotten a grasp of it.
